# SRE Project: Secure, Observable, and Scalable Kubernetes Platform

## Overview
This project demonstrates a secure, observable, and scalable Kubernetes platform running locally, using GitOps (Argo CD), Istio service mesh, an observability stack, and open-source container security tools for policy enforcement and runtime visibility.

## Structure
- `manifests/` - Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, Kustomize bases
- `docs/` - Documentation
- `scripts/` - Helper scripts
- `.github/` - GitHub workflows

## Steps
1. Local Kubernetes Cluster Setup
2. GitOps Implementation with Argo CD
3. Service Mesh with Istio
4. Observability Stack
5. Microservices Deployment

See `docs/` for detailed instructions.
